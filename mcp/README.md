# MCP Notes (Optional)

This project is MCP-ready in spirit. To practice:
1) Use an assistant client that supports **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.
2) Enable a **filesystem MCP server** pointing to this project folder.
3) Ask the assistant to read/write JSON itineraries (e.g., `data/2025-08-08.json`), then commit/push.

> This repo doesn't bundle an MCP server implementation to keep the web app lightweight.
